# Problem 3

Assume you are running the 311 call center for Chicago. You get a call from 3600 W
Roosevelt Ave.

# A. Of the three types of requests you have data for, which request type is the
most likely given the call came from 3600 W Roosevelt Ave? What are the
probabilities for each type of request?

# B. Let’s now assume that a call comes in about Graffiti Removal. Which is more
likely – that the call came from Garfield Park or Uptown? How much more or
less likely is it to be from Garfield Park vs Uptown?

# C. Now assume that you don’t have access to all the raw data and you know the
following things:

# There are a total of 1000 calls, 600 from Garfield Park and 400 from Uptown.
Of the 600 calls from Garfield Park, 100 of them are about Graffiti Removal.
Of the 400 calls from Uptown, 160 are about Graffiti Removal. If a call comes
about Graffiti Removal, how much more/less likely is it that the call came
from Garfield Park versus Uptown?

## Garfield Park  100/600 = 17%
   Uptown         160/400 = 40%
   If a call comes about Graffiti Removal, it is 2.35 times more likely to have come from Uptown instead
   of from Garfield Park.
